# DevTrack Roadmap

## Project Status

Currently in active development. The core structure for project and task management is in place, with basic features for creating, editing, and organizing projects and tasks. The focus is now on expanding functionality and improving the user experience.

## Roadmap

### Core Features

#### Project Management
- **Project Templates**: Create and save project templates for different project types and platforms.
- **Project Archiving**: Archive completed projects to keep your active project list organized.
- **Project Dependencies**: Define dependencies between projects (e.g., Game Engine project must be completed before Game Project).
- **Project Goals & Objectives**: Define clear goals and objectives for each project.
- **Project Budget Tracking**: Track project expenses and compare them to the budget. (future implementation)

#### Task Management
- **Subtasks**: Break down tasks into smaller subtasks for better organization.
- **Dependencies**: Define relationships between tasks (e.g., Task A must be completed before Task B can start).
- **Recurring Tasks**: Schedule tasks to repeat automatically (e.g., daily backups, weekly reports).
- **Task Prioritization**: Prioritize tasks with different levels of urgency (e.g., high, medium, low).
- **Task Estimation**: Estimate the time required to complete tasks.
- **Task Assignment & Reassignment**: Assign tasks to team members and easily reassign them as needed.
- **Task Status Tracking**: Track the status of tasks (e.g., to do, in progress, blocked, completed).

#### Progress Visualization
- **Gantt Charts**: Implement interactive Gantt charts to visualize project timelines and dependencies.
- **Kanban Boards**: Provide Kanban boards for a more agile and visual task management approach.
- **Progress Tracking**: Add progress bars and visual indicators to track project and task completion.
- **Burndown Charts**: Visualize the rate of progress and work remaining over time. (future implementation)
- **Velocity Tracking**: Track team velocity to estimate future project completion times. (future implementation)

### Other Features

#### Collaboration & Team Management
- **User Roles and Permissions**: Control access to projects and features based on user roles.
- **Team Communication**: Integrate communication channels (e.g., chat, forums) for efficient collaboration.
- **Task Assignment & Notifications**: Assign tasks to team members and send notifications about updates.
- **Shared Task Lists**: Create shared task lists for team projects.
- **Team Member Availability**: Track team member availability and workload. (future implementation)
- **Real-time Collaboration**: Enable real-time collaboration on tasks and documents. (future implementation)

#### Platform-Specific Features
- **Platform-Specific Templates**: Create predefined project templates tailored to common platform requirements (e.g., game development, mobile app development).
- **Platform-Specific Checklists**: Include platform-specific checklists and milestones.
- **Platform-Specific Integrations**: Integrate with platform-specific tools and SDKs.
- **Platform-Specific Deployment Tools**: Integrate with deployment tools and platforms for different platforms (e.g., Steam for game distribution, app stores for mobile apps). (future implementation)

#### Integrations
- **Version Control**: Integrate with popular version control systems like Git (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket).
- **Cloud Storage**: Enable syncing with cloud storage services (e.g., Google Drive, Dropbox) for project backups and file sharing.
- **Communication Tools**: Connect with Slack, Discord, or other communication platforms for seamless collaboration.
- **Issue Tracking**: Integrate with issue tracking systems like Jira or Bugzilla.
- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**: Integrate with CI/CD pipelines for automated builds and deployments. (future implementation)

#### Reporting & Analytics
- **Project Reports**: Generate reports on project progress, time spent, and resource allocation.
- **Performance Analytics**: Track key performance indicators (KPIs) to identify areas for improvement.
- **Time Tracking**: Track time spent on tasks and projects.
- **Customizable Reports**: Allow users to create custom reports based on their needs. (future implementation)

#### Customization & Extensibility
- **Custom Fields**: Allow users to add custom fields to projects and tasks to track specific information.
- **Themes & Customization**: Allow users to personalize the appearance of DevTrack.
- **Plugins & API**: Provide an API and plugin system for extending DevTrack's functionality.
- **User Preferences**: Allow users to customize their individual settings and preferences.

## Key Additions in This Version
- **Project Goals and Budget**: Added features for defining project goals and tracking budgets.
- **More Detailed Task Management**: Expanded task management with assignment, reassignment, and status tracking.
- **Advanced Progress Visualization**: Added velocity tracking for better project estimation.
- **Team Availability and Real-time Collaboration**: Introduced features for improved team coordination.
- **Platform-specific Deployment**: Added integrations with platform-specific deployment tools.
- **CI/CD Integration**: Included support for CI/CD pipelines.
- **Customizable Reports**: Allowed for more flexible reporting options.
- **Greater User Personalization**: Enhanced user preferences for a more tailored experience.
