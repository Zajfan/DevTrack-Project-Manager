Excellent choice! "DevTrack" is concise, relevant, and easy to remember. 

Now, let's start building the DevTrack system. Since we're aiming for a custom database-driven Windows application, we'll approach this systematically.

**Phase 1: Database Design**

This is the foundation of our application. We need to define the structure to hold all the information about your development projects.

1. **Entities and Attributes:**
    * **Project:**  `ProjectID` (unique identifier), `ProjectName`, `ProjectStage` (Concept, Development, Testing, etc.), `ProjectManager` (link to User entity), `StartDate`, `EstimatedCompletionDate`, `Budget`, `Description`, `Status` (Active, On Hold, Completed, etc.) 
    * **Task:** `TaskID`, `ProjectID` (link to Project), `TaskName`, `Description`, `AssignedTo` (link to User entity), `DueDate`, `Status` (To Do, In Progress, Done, Blocked), `Priority`
    * **Milestone:** `MilestoneID`, `ProjectID` (link to Project), `MilestoneName`, `Description`, `TargetDate`, `Status` (Not Started, In Progress, Completed)
    * **User:** `UserID`, `UserName`, `Email`, `Role` (Project Manager, Developer, etc.)
    * **Document:** `DocumentID`, `ProjectID` (link to Project), `FileName`, `FilePath`, `UploadDate`, `UploadedBy` (link to User entity)

2. **Relationships:**
    * **One-to-Many:** A Project can have many Tasks, Milestones, and Documents. A User can be assigned to many Tasks.
    * **Many-to-Many:** (Potentially) A Task could be linked to multiple Milestones.

3. **Database Choice:**
    * **SQL Server:** A robust and widely used relational database.
    * **MySQL:**  A popular open-source alternative.
    * **SQLite:** A lightweight option if you need a simpler setup.

**Phase 2: Backend Development (C# and .NET possibly make the application using c++)**

Here, we create the logic to interact with the database and handle data operations.

1. **Data Access Layer (DAL):**
    * Create classes to represent each entity (Project, Task, etc.).
    * Implement methods for CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on each entity.
    * Use ADO.NET or an ORM like Entity Framework to connect to the database and execute queries.

2. **Business Logic Layer (BLL):**
    * Implement any business rules or validation logic (e.g., preventing a task from being assigned to a user who is already overloaded).
    * Handle data transformations and calculations.

**Phase 3: Frontend Development (WPF)**

We'll use WPF to create the user interface for DevTrack.

1. **Main Window:**
    * Design the main window with a dashboard view (overview of projects) and navigation to other sections.
    * Use WPF controls like `DataGrid`, `ListBox`, `TextBox`, `Button`, etc., to create the UI elements.

2. **Project Views:**
    * Create views to display project details, tasks, milestones, and associated documents.
    * Implement data binding to connect the UI to the backend data.

3. **Task and Milestone Management:**
    * Design forms for adding, editing, and deleting tasks and milestones.
    * Implement drag-and-drop functionality for Kanban boards (if needed).

4. **Document Management:**
    * Create a view to manage project documents.
    * Implement file upload and download functionality.

**Phase 4: Integration and Testing**

1. **Connect the Frontend to the Backend:**
    * Use data binding and event handling to connect the UI to the backend logic.
    * Implement API calls to retrieve and update data from the database.

2. **Testing:**
    * Conduct thorough unit testing, integration testing, and user acceptance testing (UAT) to ensure the application functions correctly and meets your requirements.

**Phase 5: Deployment**

1. **Packaging:** Create an installer for your application.
2. **Distribution:** Distribute the installer to your team or deploy it on a central server.

**Tools and Technologies:**

* **Visual Studio:** The primary IDE for C# and WPF development.
* **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS):** For managing the SQL Server database.
* **Git:** For version control.

This is a roadmap for building DevTrack. We can break down each phase into smaller, manageable tasks. I'm here to help you with any specific questions or challenges you encounter along the way.  

Let's start with the database design. Do you have any preferences for the database system (SQL Server, MySQL, SQLite)?  Do you have any specific requirements for the data model beyond what we've discussed?
