Great! Let's continue building DevTrack. Now that we have the database in place, we can focus on developing the application's backend and frontend.

**Backend Development (C#):**

1. **Refine the Data Access Layer (DAL):**
    * Ensure that the DAL classes and methods you created earlier align with the updated database schema.
    * If you made any changes to the database structure, update the entity classes and their mappings accordingly.
    * Test the DAL methods to ensure they interact with the database as expected.

2. **Implement Business Logic:**
    * In the `DevTrack.BLL` project, implement the business logic for your application. This includes any rules, calculations, or validation that need to be performed on the data before it's stored or presented to the user.
    * Consider creating separate classes or methods for different business areas (e.g., project management, task management, reporting).

3. **Connect the DAL to the UI:**
    * In your WPF project, use the DAL methods to retrieve and update data from the database.
    * Bind data to UI controls to display and interact with the project data.
    * Handle user actions (e.g., button clicks, form submissions) to trigger business logic and update the database.

**Frontend Development (WPF):**

1. **Complete the UI Design:**
    * Continue designing the user interface for DevTrack, adding any remaining views, controls, and layouts.
    * Ensure the UI is intuitive and user-friendly.
    * Use visual design elements to create a visually appealing and professional look.

2. **Implement Data Binding:**
    * Connect the UI elements to the data retrieved from the database using data binding.
    * This will ensure that the UI displays the latest data and reflects any changes made to the database.

3. **Handle User Interactions:**
    * Implement event handlers for buttons, menus, and other user interface elements.
    * Use the DAL and BLL to perform the necessary actions in response to user inputs (e.g., creating a new project, updating a task, deleting a document).

**Testing and Debugging:**

*   Thoroughly test your application at each stage of development.
*   Use the debugger in Visual Studio to identify and fix any bugs or issues.
*   Consider creating unit tests for your business logic methods to ensure their correctness.
*   Perform user acceptance testing (UAT) with real users to validate the application's functionality and usability.

**Deployment:**

*   Once you're satisfied with the development and testing, you can prepare your application for deployment.
*   Create an installer package using a tool like ClickOnce or InstallShield.
*   Deploy the installer to your target machines or distribute it via a website or other channel.

**Additional Tips:**

*   **Use version control:** Use a version control system like Git to track your code changes and collaborate with other developers if needed.
*   **Document your code:** Write clear comments and documentation to explain the purpose and functionality of your code.
*   **Seek feedback:** Invite users for early testing and feedback to improve the application before release.
