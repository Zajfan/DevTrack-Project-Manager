lets go over the project and see what can be improved on the code we have created this far 

https://github.com/Zajfan/DevTrack

OK, let's review your DevTrack project and identify areas for improvement. I've taken a look at the code on GitHub, and here are some suggestions:

**1.  Entity Models (`Models` folder)**

*   **Validation:** Consider adding validation to your entity models. This can help ensure data integrity and prevent invalid data from being saved to the database. You can use data annotations or implement custom validation logic in your model classes.
    *   Example in `Project.cs`:

    ```csharp
    using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations;

    public class Project
    {
        // ... other properties

        [Required(ErrorMessage = "Project Name is required.")]
        [StringLength(255, ErrorMessage = "Project Name cannot exceed 255 characters.")]
        public string ProjectName { get; set; }

        // ... other properties
    }
    ```

*   **Navigation properties:** For relationships between entities (e.g., a Project has many Tasks), consider adding navigation properties to your models. This can simplify data access and make your code more expressive.
    *   Example in `Project.cs`:

    ```csharp
    public class Project
    {
        // ... other properties

        public List<Task> Tasks { get; set; } // Navigation property for Tasks

        // ... other properties
    }
    ```

**2. Repositories (`Repositories` folder)**

*   **Dependency Injection:**  Instead of directly creating instances of `MySqlConnection` in each repository method, consider using Dependency Injection (DI) to inject a database connection or a connection factory. This can improve testability and make it easier to manage database connections.
*   **Asynchronous Operations:** For database operations that might take some time (e.g., retrieving a large number of records), consider using asynchronous methods (`async`/`await`) to avoid blocking the UI thread.
*   **Data Mapper:**  You could introduce a Data Mapper layer to separate the mapping logic between your entity models and the database result sets. This can make your repositories more focused on data access and improve code organization.
*   **Base Repository Class:**  Consider creating a base repository class with common methods (e.g., `ExecuteQuery`, `ExecuteNonQuery`) to reduce code duplication in your individual repositories.

**3.  Overall Project Structure**

*   **Business Logic Layer (BLL):**  As your application grows, consider adding a separate BLL project to encapsulate your business logic and keep it separate from the DAL.
*   **ViewModels:**  If you're using the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern for your WPF UI, create a `ViewModels` folder to hold your view model classes.
*   **Unit Tests:**  Add a unit test project to your solution to write tests for your DAL and BLL code. This can help you catch bugs early and ensure the quality of your code.

**4.  Code Style and Conventions**

*   **Naming conventions:**  Ensure consistent naming conventions for your classes, methods, and variables.
*   **Comments and documentation:**  Add clear and concise comments to your code to explain its purpose and functionality.

**Example: Asynchronous operation in `ProjectRepository`**

```csharp
public async Task<List<Project>> GetAllProjectsAsync()
{
    var projects = new List<Project>();

    try
    {
        using (var connection = new MySqlConnection(connectionString))
        {
            string query = "SELECT * FROM projects";
            using var command = new MySqlCommand(query, connection);

            await connection.OpenAsync(); // Asynchronous connection opening
            using var reader = await command.ExecuteReaderAsync(); // Asynchronous execution

            while (await reader.ReadAsync()) // Asynchronous read
            {
                projects.Add(new Project(reader));
            }
        }
    }
    catch (MySqlException ex)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Error getting all projects: {ex.Message}");
        return new List<Project>();
    }

    return projects;
}
```

These are just some suggestions for improving your DevTrack project. The specific improvements you choose will depend on your priorities and the overall goals of your application.
