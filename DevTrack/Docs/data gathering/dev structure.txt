OK, let's craft a Windows application tailored for a custom database-driven project management system. 

**Core Application Features:**

1.  **Project Dashboard:**
    *   Overview of all projects, categorized by stage (Concept, Development, etc.).
    *   Key metrics displayed: Total projects, projects per stage, overdue projects, etc.
    *   Visualizations like charts or progress bars for quick insights.

2.  **Project Details View:**
    *   Displays full project information from the database.
    *   Ability to edit and update project details.
    *   Tabular view for tasks, milestones, and associated documents.

3.  **Task Management:**
    *   Add, edit, and delete tasks within each project.
    *   Assign deadlines and responsible parties.
    *   Mark tasks as completed.
    *   Option to view tasks in a Kanban-style board or list.

4.  **Milestone Tracking:**
    *   Create and track key milestones for each project.
    *   Set target dates and completion status.
    *   Visual representation of milestone progress on a timeline.

5.  **Document Management:**
    *   Upload and store project-related documents.
    *   Link documents to specific tasks or milestones.
    *   Preview or download documents directly from the application.

6.  **Reporting & Analytics:**
    *   Generate customizable reports on project status, resource allocation, and budget tracking.
    *   Filter and sort data to focus on specific aspects.
    *   Export reports in various formats (PDF, Excel, etc.).

**Technology Choices:**

*   **Frontend:** Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) or Universal Windows Platform (UWP) for building the user interface.
*   **Backend:** C# and .NET framework for application logic and database connectivity.
*   **Database:** A relational database like SQL Server or MySQL, or consider a NoSQL database if your data structure is more flexible.
*   **ORM (Optional):** An object-relational mapper like Entity Framework to simplify database interactions.

**Development Steps:**

1.  **Database Design:** Design your custom database schema based on your project information template.
2.  **Backend Development:** Create data access layers to interact with the database.
3.  **Frontend Development:** Build the user interface using WPF or UWP.
4.  **Integration:** Connect the frontend to the backend to enable data retrieval and manipulation.
5.  **Testing & Deployment:** Thoroughly test the application and deploy it on Windows machines.

**Additional Considerations:**

*   **User Authentication & Authorization:** Implement security to control access to project data.
*   **Notifications & Alerts:** Set up notifications for overdue tasks, upcoming milestones, etc.
*   **Customization:** Allow users to tailor the dashboard and views according to their preferences.
*   **Mobile App (Optional):** Develop a companion mobile app for remote access.

This is a high-level overview of building a custom database-driven project management Windows application. Remember to break down the development into smaller, manageable tasks, and consider agile development methodologies for iterative progress. With careful planning and execution, you can create a powerful tool tailored to your specific project management needs.

**Please note:** This is a complex project that may require significant development time and resources. If you're not familiar with Windows application development, consider seeking assistance from experienced developers or exploring off-the-shelf project management solutions that offer customization options.
